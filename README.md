Local News Data
==========


Attached, CSVs of ABC7NY and KCRA (from Sacramento), spanning July 18 to January 16. All times are Eastern Standard Time. 


## Questions

- Do crime, politics and other "hard news" stories make up the majority of the stories?

- What stories tend to be published at primetime hours (mornings, lunch break and evenings)?

- Which non-local stories with geographic tag are published to local TV news sites (i.e. stories and New York and Ohio appear a lot in Sacramento's KCRA website).

- Are there big bumps in coverage about wildfires and other news events?

- Weather is huge in local news. Does the data bear that out?

- Any statistical regressions we might do to reveal interesting trends, patterns or outliers?
